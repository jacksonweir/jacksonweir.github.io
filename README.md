### About me

I am a 2nd year PhD student in the Harvard [Biological and Biomedical Sciences](https://bbsphd.hms.harvard.edu/) program supervised by [Fei Chen](https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/fei-chen). I develop new spatial sequencing technologies to understand tumour evolution and tissue dynamics. 

I received my Bachelor of Science in Cell and Molecular Biology at the University of New Brunswick in 2021. As an undergraduate, I studied the anti-cancer immune response in blood cancer.
