### About me

I am a 2nd year PhD student in the Harvard [Biological and Biomedical Sciences](https://bbsphd.hms.harvard.edu/) program supervised by [Fei Chen](https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/fei-chen). I received my Bachelor of Science in Cell and Molecular Biology from the University of New Brunswick in 2021. 

I develop spatial genomics technologies to answer pressing biological questions about tissue development and dysfunction. I am particularly focused on using spatial tools to understand intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of tumour evolution. Previously, I studied combination immunotherapies in blood malignancies.
